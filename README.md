# Cardiotocography_Classification_NN
This project aims to perform classification task on the [Cardiotocography dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography).    
In this dataset, each cardiotocograms is labeled with a fetal state: N(_Normal_), S(_Suspect_), or P(_Pathologic_). A 3-layer feedforward neural network is designed for classification, and the parameters are refined with results from k-cross validation.
